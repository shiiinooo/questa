# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Core Task Management System is the foundational feature of QUESTA that enables users to create, manage, and complete development tasks within a gamified TUI environment. This system provides the essential CRUD operations for tasks while integrating with the gamification mechanics to reward users with XP and track their progress. The system must support different task difficulties, priorities, and statuses while maintaining data persistence through JSON storage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create new tasks with specific attributes, so that I can organize my development work and earn appropriate XP rewards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new task THEN the system SHALL require a task title
2. WHEN a user creates a new task THEN the system SHALL allow selection of difficulty level (Easy/Medium/Hard)
3. WHEN a user creates a new task THEN the system SHALL allow selection of priority level (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
4. WHEN a user creates a new task THEN the system SHALL allow optional notes or description
5. WHEN a user creates a new task THEN the system SHALL assign a unique identifier to the task
6. WHEN a user creates a new task THEN the system SHALL set the initial status to "Pending"
7. WHEN a user creates a new task THEN the system SHALL assign XP values based on difficulty (Easy: 15 XP, Medium: 30 XP, Hard: 50 XP)
8. WHEN a user creates a new task THEN the system SHALL save the task to persistent storage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view all my tasks in an organized list, so that I can see what work needs to be done and track my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the task list THEN the system SHALL display all tasks with their title, difficulty, priority, and status
2. WHEN a user views the task list THEN the system SHALL show tasks sorted by creation date (newest first) by default
3. WHEN a user views the task list THEN the system SHALL display visual indicators for task difficulty using appropriate colors
4. WHEN a user views the task list THEN the system SHALL display visual indicators for task priority using appropriate styling
5. WHEN a user views the task list THEN the system SHALL display task status clearly (Pending/Active/Completed/Blocked)
6. WHEN a user views the task list THEN the system SHALL show the potential XP reward for each incomplete task
7. WHEN the task list is empty THEN the system SHALL display a helpful message encouraging task creation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to complete tasks and earn XP, so that I can progress in the gamification system and feel accomplished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user marks a task as complete THEN the system SHALL change the task status to "Completed"
2. WHEN a user completes a task THEN the system SHALL award the appropriate XP to the player
3. WHEN a user completes a task THEN the system SHALL record the completion timestamp
4. WHEN a user completes a task THEN the system SHALL save the updated task and player data to persistent storage
5. WHEN a user completes a task THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback confirming the completion
6. WHEN a user completes a task THEN the system SHALL update any relevant statistics (tasks completed, XP earned)
7. IF a task is already completed THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate completion and XP awards

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to edit existing tasks, so that I can update details, change priorities, or modify descriptions as my work evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a task to edit THEN the system SHALL display a form pre-populated with current task data
2. WHEN a user edits a task THEN the system SHALL allow modification of the title, difficulty, priority, and notes
3. WHEN a user edits a task THEN the system SHALL prevent modification of the unique identifier and creation timestamp
4. WHEN a user changes task difficulty THEN the system SHALL update the XP reward accordingly
5. WHEN a user saves task edits THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields are present
6. WHEN a user saves task edits THEN the system SHALL update the task in persistent storage
7. WHEN a user cancels task editing THEN the system SHALL discard changes and return to the previous view
8. IF a task is already completed THEN the system SHALL allow editing but prevent changes to completion status and earned XP

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to delete tasks that are no longer relevant, so that I can keep my task list clean and focused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a task to delete THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation dialog
2. WHEN a user confirms task deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the task from persistent storage
3. WHEN a user confirms task deletion THEN the system SHALL update the task list display immediately
4. WHEN a user cancels task deletion THEN the system SHALL return to the previous view without changes
5. IF a task is completed and has awarded XP THEN the system SHALL warn the user before deletion
6. WHEN a completed task is deleted THEN the system SHALL NOT remove the earned XP from the player
7. WHEN a task is deleted THEN the system SHALL ensure the action cannot be undone

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my tasks and progress to be automatically saved, so that I don't lose my work if the application closes unexpectedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any task operation is performed THEN the system SHALL automatically save data to JSON files
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load existing tasks and player data from JSON files
3. WHEN JSON files don't exist THEN the system SHALL create them with default empty structures
4. WHEN JSON files are corrupted THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and create backup files
5. WHEN saving data THEN the system SHALL ensure atomic writes to prevent data corruption
6. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL validate JSON structure and handle missing fields with defaults
7. WHEN data operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error messages to the user

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to change task status between different states, so that I can accurately reflect my current work progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user changes task status THEN the system SHALL support transitions between Pending, Active, Blocked, and Completed states
2. WHEN a task is set to Active THEN the system SHALL allow transition back to Pending or forward to Completed/Blocked
3. WHEN a task is set to Blocked THEN the system SHALL allow transition back to Pending or Active
4. WHEN a task is set to Completed THEN the system SHALL prevent transition to other states unless explicitly allowed
5. WHEN task status changes THEN the system SHALL update the visual display immediately
6. WHEN task status changes THEN the system SHALL save the updated status to persistent storage
7. WHEN task status changes to Completed THEN the system SHALL trigger XP award and completion timestamp recording
